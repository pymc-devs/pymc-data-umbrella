# Webinars
We will be hosting a series of webinars to help you prepare for the sprint. You can find them in this Youtube Playlist for [PyMC Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBKcU7Ik-ir99uTvN0315hIVLuyj4Q1Gt)

These webinars are designed to provide a path from little python knowledge
to contributing to PyMC. You should start with the event that best suits
yourself:

* Non-Python nor PyMC users {fas}`hand-point-right` {ref}`array_ops`
* Python but not PyMC users {fas}`hand-point-right` {ref}`probprog_pymc`
* PyMC users {fas}`hand-point-right` {ref}`contributing_to_pymc` and/or {ref}`contributing_docs`

And not only that, are you wondering what is PyMC? What is it used for? to decide
if you'd be interested in learning and contributing to PyMC?

We also have a talk for you! In the talk embedded below, Oriol Abril Pla gives an
overview of the Bayesian paradigm, probabilistic programming and PyMC,
covering also a couple case studies to showcase its use in real scenarios.
