## Inspirational Tips on Contributing to Open Source

- "I wish someone had told me earlier how amazing open source is and I had become involved earlier."
- Participating in and influencing decisions in the open source community is important.
- Open source lets us learn about: continuous integration, unit tests, documentation, packaging
