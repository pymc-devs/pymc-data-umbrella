# About PyMC

[PyMC](https://www.pymc.io) is a probabilistic programming package for Python that allows users to fit Bayesian models using a variety of numerical methods, most notably Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and variational inference (VI). Its flexibility and extensibility make it applicable to a large suite of problems. PyMC is a non-profit project under NumFOCUS.

Below we have a series of videos on PyMC and contributing to the library. We encourage you to watch the videos and bookmark the [PyMC Series playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBKcU7Ik-ir99uTvN0315hIVLuyj4Q1Gt). A subset of these videos focus on [How to Contribute to PyMC](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD1x-BW9UdeEPD_4E4VOcj0q66kQpdcKz).
