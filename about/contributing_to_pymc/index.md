# Contributing to PyMC

## Event
From first time contributor to project maintainer. What is it like? In this testimonial, Ricardo Vieira revisits the steps of his first ever contributions to Open Source Software, to the PyMC library. He then jumps one year into the present and shows what reviewing someone elseâ€™s first time contribution looks like. Hopefully, this will help demystify open source contributions without taking any of the magic out of them! This presentation was described as "inspiring and authentic".
