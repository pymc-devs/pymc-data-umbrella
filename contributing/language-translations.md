# Language Translations

## Requirements
- Transifex account (or GitHub one to log in with it)
- Knowledge of English
- Knowledge of Spanish or Portuguese

## About
We are using [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/) to manage the language translations, which provides a translation infrastructure with Sphinx. Transifex is *a global content repository with a REST API, SDKs, automation, and more so you can centrally manage your source content and translations and build amazing multilingual digital experiences for your users.*

### Languages

This translation is maintained by Spanish and Portuguese speakers from all around the globe. We don't want to tie it to any region in particular and we believe this is an extra value of its own diversity. You will find sections in different styles and tones, we only ask not changing the style every paragraph nor using very specific regionalisms.

**Language codes**:  we are using "es" and "pt" codes which are the general language codes and are not tied to any region.

The languages text is borrowed from: Python Documentation [GuÃ­a para contribuir en la traducciÃ³n](https://python-docs-es.readthedocs.io/es/3.11/CONTRIBUTING.html#a-tener-en-cuenta).
