## About: why we are adding timestamps

We have a collection of videos on YouTube from PyMCon 2020 and PyMCon Web Series.

:stopwatch: We are adding timestamps to the PyMC YouTube videos.  When timestamps are available:
1. It makes it easy for viewers to get to the part in the video they are interested in.
2. It also helps potential viewers find the video based on their search terms.

## Workflow

Complete instructions are available in [Issue 11: adding timestamps to videos](https://github.com/pymc-devs/video-timestamps/issues/11).
