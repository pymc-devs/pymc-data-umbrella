# Help with the Sprint

## ...with the website
To build the website locally, install the requirements

`pip install -r requirements-docs.txt`

and then run sphinx:

`sphinx-build . build -b html`

## ...with outreach
Share the announcements on social networks, within your personal networks...

Some outreach related advise:
* Always use [https://pymc-data-umbrella.xyz](https://pymc-data-umbrella.xyz) when linking
  to the general series of events, use links within this domain for specific links to single
  events or external links (i.e. direct link to webinar or to registration form).

  **DO NOT USE** `pymc-data-umbrella.readthedocs.io` nor `sprint-pymc-data-umbrella.readhedocs.io`
  domains.
* Use "events" to refer indisctintively to any event in the series, be it one of the webinars or the
  sprint session.
* Use "webinars" too refer to the webinars we are hosting in preparation of the sprint. Try
  to avoid "tutorials" as it can be confusing with the content of the documentation webinar.
  If you need some alternative to "webinar" consider using "event" or "workshop" before for example.

## ...paving the way of new contributors
Help with issue triaging on both pymc and pymc-examples repo

## ...translating content

:::{note}
We first need to set up the translation infrastructure with sphinx, which we have never
done before. If you know how to do it, please reach out.

If you'd like to volunteer with translations only, let us know too, but we ask you to be
patient for now. There is nothing yet for translators to work on.
