### Some outreach related advise

* Always use [https://pymc-data-umbrella.xyz](https://pymc-data-umbrella.xyz) when linking
  to the general series of events, use links within this domain for specific links to single
  events or external links (i.e. direct link to webinar or to registration form).

* Use "events" to refer indistinctively to any event in the series, be it one of the webinars or the
  sprint session.
* Use "webinars" to refer to the webinars we are hosting in preparation of the sprint. Try
  to avoid "tutorials" as it can be confusing with the content of the documentation webinar.
  If you need some alternative to "webinar" consider using "event" or "workshop" before for example.

## Language translations

We are translating the website from English to other languages. The first couple of languages we are focusing on are Spanish and Portuguese. For more detailed instructions on how you can submit translations, see {ref}`translations`.

If you are interested in translating to another language, please open up an [issue](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc-data-umbrella/issues) with any suggestions.
