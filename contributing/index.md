### Some outreach related advise

* Always use [https://pymc-data-umbrella.xyz](https://pymc-data-umbrella.xyz) when linking
  to the general series of events, use links within this domain for specific links to single
  events or external links (i.e. direct link to webinar or to registration form).

* Use "events" to refer indistinctively to any event in the series, be it one of the webinars or the
  sprint session.
* Use "webinars" to refer to the webinars we are hosting in preparation of the sprint. Try
  to avoid "tutorials" as it can be confusing with the content of the documentation webinar.
  If you need some alternative to "webinar" consider using "event" or "workshop" before for example.

## Paving the way of new contributors

Help with issue triaging on both [pymc](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc) and [pymc-examples](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc-examples) repo.

## Translating content (set-up in progress)

:::{note}
We first need to set up the translation infrastructure with sphinx. If you know how to do it or are interested in translating, please reach out.

In the meantime, if you would to volunteer for translations, please add your information to [Issue #99](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc-data-umbrella/issues/99) on GitHub. We will be in touch when we are ready to move forward on this project.
