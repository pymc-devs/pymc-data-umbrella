"In this task Oriol gives an overview of PyMC, and why it is beneficial to "
"supercharge your data science skills with probabilistic programming. The "
"presentation is organized by layers from more generic to more specific. The "
"following are covered:  the main features of the Bayesian paradigm, "
"probabilistic progamming, PyMC and finishing by covering some hands on "
"examples of Bayesian modeling with PyMC."
