"[PyMC](https://www.pymc.io) is a probabilistic programming package for "
"Python that allows users to fit Bayesian models using a variety of numerical"
" methods, most notably Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and variational "
"inference (VI). Its flexibility and extensibility make it applicable to a "
"large suite of problems. PyMC is a non-profit project under NumFOCUS."
