"In the last ten years, there have been a number of advancements in the study"
" of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and variational inference algorithms that have "
"enabled effective Bayesian statistical computation for much more complicated"
" models than were previously feasible. These algorithmic advancements have "
"been accompanied by a number of open source probabilistic programming "
"packages that make them accessible to the general engineering, statistics, "
"and data science communities. PyMC is one such package written in Python and"
" supported by NumFOCUS. This talk will give an introduction to probabilistic"
" programming with PyMC, with a particular emphasis on the how open source "
"probabilistic programming makes Bayesian inference algorithms near the "
"frontier of academic research accessible to a wide audience."
