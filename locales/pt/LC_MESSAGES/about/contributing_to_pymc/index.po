"From first time contributor to project maintainer. What is it like? In this "
"testimonial, Ricardo Vieira revisits the steps of his first ever "
"contributions to Open Source Software, to the PyMC library. He then jumps "
"one year into the present and shows what reviewing someone elseâ€™s first time"
" contribution looks like. Hopefully, this will help demystify open source "
"contributions without taking any of the magic out of them! This presentation"
" was described as \"inspiring and authentic\"."
