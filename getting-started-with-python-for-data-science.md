Getting started with Python for Data Science
--------------------------------------------

This is an hour long session to introduce you to Python, we have some specific aims in mind:

- Using Python with Numpy, Pandas etc to work with data
- Motivating you to contribute to Open source libraries in Python, especially the ones related to Machine Learning / Data Science

This event is a part of a larger series of PyMC - Data Umbrella events, which are aimed at helping you contribute to PyMC (Open source library for Probabilistic Programming in Python)
