# Frequently Asked Questions

## Do I need to be a PyMC user to participate in the open source working session?

**Response:**  It is not necessary to be a PyMC user to contribute to this open source project. There are a number of issues where we could use your contribution. Examples:
- Adding timestamps to videos from our PyMCon conference
- Updating docstrings in documentation. We have a webinar: {ref}`example_pr`; with explanation, background and examples on how to do it.
- Updating the style and formatting of {doc}`example notebooks <nb:gallery>`. We have a webinar: {ref}`contributing_docs`; with explanation, background and examples on how to do it.

## Are we required to attend all the sessions in order to sign up?

**Response:** It is *not required* to attend all the sessions. Ideally, it is beneficial if folks can attend as many sessions as they can, to build up their open source skills and familiarity with the PyMC project. Some sessions may be more convenient for your time zone.

## Is there a requirement to have attended #1 of the working session?

**Response:** The Pre-event office hours are an opportunity for incoming contributors to ask questions for the upcoming working sessions.  It is *not required* to attend a specific session as a prerequisite for other sessions.  Ideally, it is beneficial if folks can attend as many sessions as they can, to build up their open source skills and familiarity with the PyMC project.

If you are unable to attend the Pre-event office hours, you can ask your questions in one of these ways:
