# Frequently Asked Questions

## Do I need to be a PyMC user to participate in the open source working session?

**Response:**  It is not necessary to be a PyMC user to contribute to this open source project. There are a number of issues where we could use your contribution. Examples:  
- Adding timestamps to videos from our PyMCon conference
- Updating docstrings in documentation
- Update notebooks to v4.  This video, [Contributing to PyMC Documentation](https://youtu.be/fzpmLWQNj4A) provides a background and examples.
