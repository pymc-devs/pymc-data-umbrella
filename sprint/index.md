# Open Source Working Sessions

Data Umbrella is organizing a series of open source working sessions to contribute to the PyMC project. For more information, see {ref}`Resources <resources>` section.

## Sprint - Goals

In this sprint we’re focusing on bringing in new contributors, we sincerely hope this will be a welcoming, inclusive experience for you into the world of open source software. We hope to help you to the best of our abilities and learn from you as well!
The sprint will consist of small resolvable issues and contributing to the PyMC documentation, so if you aren’t experienced in software development no worries at all, you can contribute to documentation with knowledge of markdown or statistics.
Here’s the fun part, we’ll be giving away stickers, mugs and the Bayesian Computation book by PyMC Developers Ravin, Junpeng and Osvaldo!!! Find the schedule and all other details {ref}`here <current_sprint>`.

## Sprint - Requirements

- Get your laptop, and some stable internet connection!
- Working knowledge of terminal and git
- Setup a python virtual environment beforehand!
- Other than these two you can make different kinds of contributions with different skill sets, for example:
  - You can contribute to documentation with knowledge of markdown and maybe some basic statistics
  - You can contribute to CI/CD issues or Python issues with basic knowledge of programming
  - You can contribute to core codebase with knowledge of Python + Bayesian Statistics
