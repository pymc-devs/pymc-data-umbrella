# Sprint

The team at PyMC is organizing an open source sprint in collaboration with Data Umbrella, an organization for underrepresented persons in data science. This sprint will take place in two slots of two hours each to accommodate as many time zones as we can. If you’re a prospective participant do know that there will be at least two members of the PyMC team present throughout the sprint on discord and zoom to help you out. Additionally, there’s a ton of resources to help you get started and prepare beforehand other than the webinars we're conducting, you can find them here:

## Sprint - Resources

- [PyMC - Data Umbrella series content and videos](https://pymc-data-umbrella.xyz/en/latest/webinars/index.html) (all webinar materials have been uploaded to this website, videos are embedded too so you have everything just a click away)

- [Sprint Cheat Sheet](https://pymc-data-umbrella.xyz/en/latest/about/decision_tree.html#your-sprint-cheat-sheet)

## Sprint - Goals

In this sprint we’re focusing on bringing in new contributors, we sincerely hope this will be a welcoming, inclusive experience for you into the world of open source software. We hope to help you to the best of our abilities and learn from you as well!
The sprint will consist of small resolvable issues and contributing to the PyMC documentation, so if you aren’t experienced in software development no worries at all, you can contribute to documentation with knowledge of markdown or statistics.
Here’s the fun part, we’ll be giving away stickers, mugs and the Bayesian Computation book by PyMC Developers Ravin, Junpeng and Osvaldo!!! Find the schedule and all other details on pymc-data-umbrella.xyz

## Sprint - Requirements

- Get your laptop, and some stable internet connection!
- Working knowledge of terminal and git
- Setup a python virtual environment beforehand!
- Other than these two you can make different kinds of contributions with different skill sets, for example:
  - You can contribute to documentation with knowledge of markdown and maybe some basic statistics
  - You can contribute to CI/CD issues or Python issues with basic knowledge of programming
  - You can contribute to core codebase with knowledge of Python + Bayesian Statistics
  - Note: [Check the sprint cheat sheet](https://pymc-data-umbrella.xyz/en/latest/about/decision_tree.html#your-sprint-cheat-sheet) to know a suitable area of contribution and some resources to prepare you for it
