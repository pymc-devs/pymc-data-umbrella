## Sprint

We want to accommodate people from all over the globe, and we know time zones are a pain, so this won’t be a timed sprint, you don’t have to sit at one place and immediately smash your keyboard for 4 hours, we don’t need you to do that, take it easy!!

We’ll provide you with a list of issues marked for the data umbrella sprint, that we are confident you can take care of!
Browse through these issues, pick something that interests you, see if you have a possible fix in mind, if not, comment that you’d like to help and you want help, we’ll tell you where to start.

Once you have some idea of what to do, make a Pull Request, it doesn’t have to be perfect, just a starting point, we’ll review it and see if there aren’t any gaps. That’s all, voila! Here's your open source contribution!!
If you’ve reached till here, go back to step 1, find another issue.

If you merged a few PRs, congratulations!! You deserve a pat!
It’s okay if you didn’t merge a PR, we’re so excited you took interest in open source.


### Requirements

- working knowledge of some programming language (preferably python, if not, no worries! you can attend a pre main event session to get some familiarity with python, it will be accessible as long as you know at least one language)

- get your laptop, and some stable internet connection!

- familiarity with basic statistics (i.e. high school / sophomore undergrad level stats courses, you don’t need to know a lot, we’ll explain the basics real quick!)

### Target Audience

* Current working professionals in data science/software engineering
* People with a statistical background
* Someone who has already contributed to open source
* Students or anyone in the community who is completely new to open source but wants to try!

### Goals

- Involve more of the community in contributing to PyMC
- Additionally, letting people know that documentation contributions are part of open source and thereby involving more people in PyMC Documentation work.
