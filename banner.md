This [figure](banner.png) is generated from [this code](banner.py), the code in this link is a trivial customization of the [original code](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymcon/blob/gh-pages/assets/make_trajectories.py) by [Colin Caroll](https://colindcarroll.com) who designed a [similar banner for pymcon'20](https://pymc-devs.github.io/pymcon//), Colin is amazing at visualization stuff and even has a couple of [talks](https://github.com/ColCarroll/yourplotlib) about it!!
