# Contributing to PyMC Documentation

## Event
The best library of the world is completely useless if it is not properly documented
as therefore nobody can really use it. PyMC has an extensive documentation corpus
with examples of all kinds which has been build since its initial release
_back in 2015!_ In this webinar we'll explain how to contribute to PyMC documentation
to update it to our new infrastructure built during the last 8 months
thanks to Outreachy and GSoD.

## Details

- Audience: People who are interested in contributing to PyMC documentation.
  - Requirements: markdown
- [Github Repo](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc-data-umbrella)
- All the content is available on this website, which is built with the same tools
  we use for PyMC documentation.
