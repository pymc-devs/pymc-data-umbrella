# Getting started with Python for Data Science

This is an hour long session to introduce you to Python, we have some specific aims in mind:

- Using Python with Numpy, Pandas etc to work with data
- Motivating you to contribute to Open source libraries in Python, especially the ones related to Machine Learning / Data Science

This event is a part of a larger series of PyMC - Data Umbrella events, which are aimed at helping you contribute to PyMC (Open source library for Probabilistic Programming in Python)

## Speaker

[Meenal](https://mjhajharia.com) is a computer science and mathematics undergraduate in junior year. She has been working on Bayesian time series estimation models with PyMC, this project started when she was a Google Summer of Codeâ€™21 student . Generally she is interested in Probabilistic Programming, NLP, and algorithmic fairness.
