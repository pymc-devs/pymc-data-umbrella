<!-- This is a comment which won't appear on the rendered site and should not be copied
when adding yourself as contributor.

Pay attention to the empty lines! This is Markdown!

The empty line between the name and the location places them in different lines
in the rendered output. The *lack* of empty lines between the social links
keeps them all in the same line -->
